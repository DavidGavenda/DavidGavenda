# Hello there! :vulcan_salute:

Welcome to my GitHub page! Here you will find a comprehensive collection of my academic work, including assignments and my Master's thesis. This portfolio offers an insight into my progression and accomplishments throughout my studies in Computer Science at FEI STU.

## Repositories:

- **School-Assignments-Bc**: This repository holds assignments from my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at FEI STU (2018 - 2021).
- **School-Assignments-Ing**: This repository houses assignments from my Master's degree in Computer Science at FEI STU (2021 - 2023).
- **People-detection-in-historical-photographs**: This repository is dedicated to my Master's thesis, which focuses on object detection in historical photographs. I explored over 70 models, trained custom models, and utilized multiple GAN networks for the restoration and generation of old photographs. The documentation for this project was done in Overleaf using LaTeX.
- **FP**: A final team project where we developed a web search application for Brazilian websites using Haskell.
- **blockchain-school-server**: A collaborative project where we used blockchain technology to build an academic information website.
- **WebteFinalne**: A repository for the final team assignment where we created a website.
- **ASOS-R**: A team assignment where we explored and presented the R programming language with practical examples.
